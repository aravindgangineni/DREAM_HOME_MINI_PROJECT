# DreamHomeMiniProject
This project is about a property rental company called DreamHome. "The purpose of the DreamHome database system is to maintain the data that is used and generated to support the property rental business for our clients and property owners and to facilitate the cooperation and sharing of information between branches".
We have designed Entity-Relationship diagram(ER) using dbdiagram.io and we have created the database in MySQL Workbench. For creating the User-Interface(UI) we used a programing language  such as Python library tkinter.
